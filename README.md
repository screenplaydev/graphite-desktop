## What is Graphite?

[Graphite](https://graphite.dev) is a **fast, simple code review platform** designed for engineers who want to **write and review smaller pull requests, stay unblocked, and ship faster**.  Anyone can start using Graphite individually without needing their coworkers to change tools - we'll seamlessly sync your code changes and reviews.  We built Graphite because we missed internal code review tools like Phabricator (at Facebook) and Critique (Google) that help engineers create, approve, and ship small, incremental changes, and long-term we’re passionate about creating products & workflows that help fast-moving eng teams achieve more.

Graphite is designed to be used at work - unfortunately we don't yet support submitting PRs to open-source repos as an external contributor (i.e. without write access) due to limitations of GitHub.

## Graphite beta

Graphite is currently in closed beta, and you’ll need a Graphite account to submit pull requests with the CLI.  You can [sign up for the waitlist](https://graphite.dev) for early access - we'll let you skip the line if someone on your team already uses Graphite!
